/**
 *  Class for encapsulating Google Places API "Nearby Search" request
 *  See https://developers.google.com/places/documentation/search#PlaceSearchRequests
 *
 *  A Nearby Search lets you search for Places within a specified area.
 *  You can refine your search request by supplying keywords or specifying
 *  the type of Place you are searching for.
 *
 *  FTGooglePlacesAPINearbySearchRequest and FTGooglePlacesAPITextSearchRequest
 *  have a lot of the same code. They don't have the common superclass
 *  (and so have copied code) to make them totaly standalone.
 *  We don't have any quarantee the single concrete request won't change
 *  in the future (keys dependency or exclusivity etc.) and shared common
 *  code and properties could cause a lot of trouble in that case
